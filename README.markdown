# C# Style Guide

This style guide is to keep the code consistent and to improve the readability.

## Inspiration

This style guide is based on C# and Unity conventions.

## Nomenclature

On the whole, naming should follow C# standards.

### Namespaces

Namespaces are all **PascalCase**, multiple words concatenated together, without hyphens ( - ) or underscores ( \_ ). The exception to this rule are acronyms like GUI or HUD, which can be uppercase:

**AVOID**:

```csharp
com.name.fpsgame.hud.healthbar
```

**PREFER**:

```csharp
Name.FPSGame.HUD.Healthbar
```

### Classes & Interfaces

Classes and interfaces are written in **PascalCase**. For example `RadialSlider`. 

### Methods

Methods are written in **PascalCase**. For example `DoSomething()`. 

### Fields

All non-static public fields are written **PascalCase**, all non-static private/protected fields are written **_camelCase**.
For example:

```csharp
public class MyClass 
{
    public int PublicField;
    int _packagePrivate;
    private int _myPrivate;
    protected int _myProtected;
}
```

**AVOID:**

```csharp
int _myPrivateVariable
```

**PREFER:**

```csharp
private int _myPrivateVariable
```

Static fields should be written in **PascalCase**:

```csharp
public static int TheAnswer = 42;
```
### Properties

All properties are written in **PascalCase**. For example:

```csharp
public int PageNumber 
{
    get { return _pageNumber; }
    set { pageNumber = value; }
}
```

### Parameters

Parameters are written in **camelCase**.

**AVOID:**

```csharp
void DoSomething(Vector3 Location)
```

**PREFER:**

```csharp
void DoSomething(Vector3 location)
```

Single character values are to be avoided except for temporary looping variables.

### Actions

Actions are written in **PascalCase**. For example:

```csharp
public event Action<int> ValueChanged;
```

### Misc

In code, acronyms should be treated as words. For example:

**AVOID:**

```csharp
XMLHTTPRequest
String URL
findPostByID
```  

**PREFER:**

```csharp
XmlHttpRequest
String url
findPostById
```

## Declarations

### Access Level Modifiers

Access level modifiers should be explicitly defined for classes, methods and member variables.

### Fields & Variables

Prefer single declaration per line.

**AVOID:**

```csharp
string _username, _twitterHandle;
```

**PREFER:**

```csharp
string _username;
string _twitterHandle;
```

### Classes

Exactly one class per source file, although inner classes are encouraged where scoping appropriate.

### Interfaces

All interfaces should be prefaced with the letter **I**. 

**AVOID:**

```csharp
RadialSlider
```

**PREFER:**

```csharp
IRadialSlider
```

## Spacing

Spacing is especially important, as code needs to be easily readable. 

### Indentation

Indentation should be done using **spaces** â€” never tabs.  

#### Blocks

Indentation for blocks uses **4 spaces** for optimal readability:

**AVOID:**

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
{
  Debug.Log("index=" + i);
}
```

**PREFER:**

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
{
    Debug.Log("index=" + i);
}
```

### Line Length

Lines should be no longer than **100** characters long.

### Vertical Spacing

There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity 
and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but 
having too many sections in a method often means you should refactor into
several methods.


## Brace Style

All braces get their own line as it is a C# convention:

**AVOID:**

```csharp
class MyClass {
    void DoSomething() {
        if (someTest) {
          // ...
        } else {
          // ...
        }
    }
}
```

**PREFER:**

```csharp
class MyClass
{
    void DoSomething()
    {
        if (someTest)
        {
          // ...
        }
        else
        {
          // ...
        }
    }
}
```

Conditional statements are always required to be enclosed with braces,
irrespective of the number of lines required.

**AVOID:**

```csharp
if (someTest)
    doSomething();  

if (someTest) doSomethingElse();
```

**PREFER:**

```csharp
if (someTest) 
{
    DoSomething();
}  

if (someTest)
{
    DoSomethingElse();
}
```

A **return** is the exception and can be written one a single line:

```csharp
if(someTest) return;
```

## Switch Statements

Switch-statements come with `default` case by default (heh). If the `default` case is never reached, be sure to remove it.

**AVOID:**  
  
```csharp
switch (variable) 
{
    case 1:
        break;
    case 2:
        break;
    default:
        break;
}
```

**PREFER:**  
  
```csharp
switch (variable) 
{
    case 1:
        break;
    case 2:
        break;
}
```

## Language

Use US English spelling.

**AVOID:**

```csharp
string colour = "red";
```

**PREFER:**

```csharp
string color = "red";
```

The exception here is `MonoBehaviour` as that's what the class is actually called.

Single line comments should include a space after the slashes.

## Comments

Only use comments when necessary.
```csharp
// Single line comment
```

**TODO** comments should also include a space after the slashes, followed by a colon.
```csharp
// TODO: Example of a reminder
```
